# üöÄ PSP Router - Implementation TODO List (ML-Based Variant)

## üìã Overview
This document outlines all the components that need to be implemented to complete the PSP Router solution. The system uses a **fine-tuned model approach** where the AI learns everything from historical transaction data.

---

## üìÖ **Implementation Timeline & Next Stages**

### **üìã Implementation Priority Order**
1. Environment configuration: OpenAI API key, fine-tuned model setup
2. Training data preparation: collect and format historical transaction data
3. Fine-tuning workflow: upload data, create job, monitor training
4. Observability: logging, metrics, tracing; robust error handling
5. Testing: integration and performance (latency + fallback)
6. Deployment: containerization, CI/CD, config management
7. Hardening: security, rate limiting, caching
8. Client SDK: sender-side library to build candidates and call API

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Dependencies**
- Environment configuration before training
- Historical transaction data before fine-tuning
- Observability before production rollout
- Database connectivity for Client SDK

### **üîÑ Sequential vs Parallel Tasks**
**Sequential:** Environment setup ‚Üí Training data ‚Üí Fine-tuning ‚Üí Observability ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment

**Parallel:** Monitoring/Rate limiting/Caching once endpoints stable

### **üéØ Success Criteria**
- P95 latency within SLA with deterministic fallback
- Schema-valid decisions with clear reasoning
- Production-grade logs/metrics/traces

## üöÄ **Phase 1: Core Functionality**

### 1. **Environment Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
- [ ] Set database connection string `PSPROUTER_DB_CONNECTION` in `.env`

#### ML-Based Setup
   - [ ] Use the trainer app (`PspRouter.Trainer`) for all training operations
   - Optional: adjust sampling via `Trainer:Sampling` in `PspRouter.Trainer/appsettings.json` (e.g., TargetSampleSize, DateWindowMonths, MaxPerSegment)
   - Run `dotnet run --project PspRouter.Trainer` to execute the workflow
   - Set the resulted model ID at env variable OPENAI_FT_MODEL (at file `FineTunedModelVariant\PspRouter.API\.env`)

#### Product-Tunable Weights (Routing)
- [ ] Configure `PspRouter:Routing:Weights` in `PspRouter.API/appsettings.json`
- [ ] Configure `AllowedHealthStatuses` in `PspRouter.API/appsettings.json`


#### Fine-tuning workflow (REQUIRED for production)
- [ ] Use the trainer app (`PspRouter.Trainer`) for all training operations
   - Adjust sampling via `Trainer:Sampling` in `PspRouter.Trainer/appsettings.json` (e.g., TargetSampleSize, DateWindowMonths, MaxPerSegment)
   - `Trainer:Sampling:TargetSampleSize` should be thousands to hundreds of thousands of rows
   - Optional: change the SQL query (within `GetTrainingData`), to achive better diverse sample for training, covering successes and failures, multiple currencies, payment methods, regions, 3DS vs non-3DS, tokenized vs non-tokenized, and a wide risk-score distribution.
   - Run `dotnet run --project PspRouter.Trainer` to execute the workflow
   - Set the resulted model ID at env variable OPENAI_FT_MODEL (at file `FineTunedModelVariant\PspRouter.API\.env`)

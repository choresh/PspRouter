# üìö AI/ML Concepts Explained for Programmers

## **A.0 Overview**
This document explains the key AI/ML concepts used in the PSP Router in programmer-friendly terms. No advanced mathematics required - just practical understanding of how these concepts work in our payment routing system.

## üé∞ **A.1 Multi-Armed Bandit: The Slot Machine Problem**

### **What is a Multi-Armed Bandit?**
A multi-armed bandit is a machine learning problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions (arms) to maximize cumulative reward over time. The name comes from slot machines (one-armed bandits) - imagine choosing between multiple slot machines to maximize winnings.

### **Real-World Analogy**
```
You're in a casino with 4 slot machines:
- Machine A: Unknown payout rate
- Machine B: Unknown payout rate  
- Machine C: Unknown payout rate
- Machine D: Unknown payout rate

Goal: Maximize your winnings over 1000 pulls
Challenge: You don't know which machine pays best!
```

### **In PSP Router Context**
```
You have 4 PSPs to choose from:
- Adyen: Unknown success rate
- Stripe: Unknown success rate
- Klarna: Unknown success rate  
- PayPal: Unknown success rate

Goal: Maximize authorization success over time
Challenge: You don't know which PSP works best for each transaction type!
```

### **Key Concepts**
- **Arms**: Available choices (in our case: Adyen, Stripe, Klarna, PayPal)
- **Reward**: Outcome of choosing an arm (authorization success, fee optimization)
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance between trying new arms vs using known good arms
- **Regret**: Difference between optimal choice and actual choice

---

## üß† **A.2 Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm: The Simple but Effective Approach**

### **What is Epsilon-Greedy?**
Epsilon-greedy is a simple algorithm that balances exploration (trying new options) with exploitation (using known good options). The "epsilon" (Œµ) parameter controls this balance.

### **How It Works**
```csharp
// Simple epsilon-greedy logic
if (random < epsilon)
    return random_arm();  // Explore (Œµ% of time)
else
    return best_known_arm();  // Exploit (1-Œµ% of time)
```

### **Real-World Example**
```
Œµ = 0.1 (10% exploration)

90% of time: Choose Adyen (best known PSP)
10% of time: Randomly try Stripe/Klarna/PayPal

After 100 transactions:
- 90 transactions: Use Adyen (exploitation)
- 10 transactions: Try others (exploration)
```

### **Why It Works**
- **Exploitation**: Uses what you know works
- **Exploration**: Discovers new opportunities
- **Learning**: Updates knowledge after each choice
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// Configuration
var epsilon = 0.1; // 10% exploration

// Decision logic
if (Random.Shared.NextDouble() < epsilon)
{
    // Explore: Try a random PSP
    return candidates[Random.Shared.Next(candidates.Count)];
}
else
{
    // Exploit: Use the PSP with highest success rate
    return candidates.OrderByDescending(c => c.AuthRate30d).First();
}
```

---

## üé≤ **A.3 Thompson Sampling: The Bayesian Approach**

### **What is Thompson Sampling?**
Thompson Sampling is a more sophisticated approach that uses probability distributions instead of simple averages. It's based on Bayesian statistics and naturally balances exploration and exploitation.

### **How It Works**
```csharp
// Bayesian approach
for each arm:
    sample = beta_distribution(alpha, beta)
    if sample > best_sample:
        best_arm = arm
return best_arm
```

### **Real-World Analogy**
```
Instead of saying "Adyen has 89% success rate"
Thompson Sampling says "Adyen's success rate is probably between 85-93%"

The algorithm samples from this probability distribution
and chooses the arm with the highest sampled value.
```

### **Why It's Better**
- **Uncertainty**: Naturally balances exploration/exploitation based on confidence
- **Adaptive**: More exploration when uncertain, less when confident
- **Bayesian**: Uses probability distributions instead of averages
- **Optimal**: Theoretically optimal for many problems

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// Each PSP has a probability distribution
Adyen: Beta(89 successes, 11 failures) ‚Üí Sample: 0.87
Stripe: Beta(78 successes, 22 failures) ‚Üí Sample: 0.82
Klarna: Beta(45 successes, 55 failures) ‚Üí Sample: 0.41

// Choose the PSP with highest sample
return "Adyen" // (0.87 > 0.82 > 0.41)
```

---

## üéØ **A.4 Contextual Bandits: Adding Transaction Context**

### **What is a Contextual Bandit?**
A contextual bandit is a multi-armed bandit that considers additional context (features) when making decisions. Instead of just choosing between arms, it considers the current situation.

### **Traditional vs Contextual Bandits**

**Traditional Bandit:**
```
Segment: "US_USD_Visa"
Decision: Always choose Adyen (89% success rate)
```

**Contextual Bandit:**
```
Segment: "US_USD_Visa"
Context: {amount: 500, risk: 30, sca: true}
Decision: Choose Stripe (better for high-risk SCA transactions)
```

### **Why Context Matters**
```
Same PSP, different contexts:
- Adyen + Low Risk + No SCA = 95% success
- Adyen + High Risk + SCA Required = 70% success

Contextual bandit learns these patterns!
```

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// Transaction context
var context = {
    "amount": 150.00m,      // ‚Üí 150.0
    "risk_score": 25,       // ‚Üí 25.0
    "sca_required": true,   // ‚Üí 1.0
    "currency": "USD",      // ‚Üí 0.123 (hash-based)
    "merchant_tier": "premium" // ‚Üí 0.456 (hash-based)
};

// Contextual decision
var decision = bandit.SelectWithContext(segmentKey, candidates, context);
```

## üîç **A.5 Semantic Search: Finding Meaning, Not Just Words**

### **What is Semantic Search?**
Semantic search finds relevant information based on meaning, not just exact word matches. It understands the intent behind queries and finds conceptually similar content.

### **Traditional vs Semantic Search**

**Traditional Search (Keyword-based):**
```
Query: "Visa card from US merchant, $200"
Search: Finds exact matches only
Result: No results found
```

**Semantic Search (Meaning-based):**
```
Query: "Visa card from US merchant, $200"
Search: Finds semantically similar transactions
Result: "Visa card from US merchant, $150, routed to Stripe, authorized in 2.3s"
```

### **Why It's Powerful**
- **Flexible**: Finds relevant content even with different wording
- **Intelligent**: Understands context and meaning
- **Comprehensive**: Captures relationships between concepts
- **Human-like**: Mimics how humans search for information

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// Query: "Visa card from US merchant, $200"
// Finds similar transactions:
// 1. "Visa card from US merchant, $150, routed to Stripe, authorized in 2.3s" (similarity: 0.95)
// 2. "Visa card from US merchant, $300, routed to Stripe, authorized in 1.8s" (similarity: 0.92)
// 3. "Visa card from US merchant, $100, routed to Adyen, authorized in 3.1s" (similarity: 0.88)
```

## üìê **A.6 Cosine Similarity: Measuring Vector Similarity**

### **What is Cosine Similarity?**
Cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. It's a mathematical way to compare the "direction" of vectors.

### **How It Works**
```
Vector A: [0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2]
Vector B: [0.2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.1]

Cosine Similarity = (A ¬∑ B) / (|A| √ó |B|)
                  = 0.85 (very similar)

Vector C: [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.7]
Cosine Similarity = 0.23 (not similar)
```

### **Why It's Useful**
- **Range**: Always between -1 and 1
- **Direction**: Measures direction, not magnitude
- **Normalized**: Works well with different vector lengths
- **Intuitive**: 1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// Transaction embeddings
var queryEmbedding = [0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.2, ...]; // Current transaction
var lessonEmbedding = [0.2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.1, ...]; // Past transaction

// Calculate similarity
var similarity = CosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, lessonEmbedding);
// Result: 0.85 (very similar transactions)
```

## üß† **A.7 LLM (Large Language Model): The AI Brain**

### **What is an LLM?**
A Large Language Model is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. In our case, we use GPT-4 to make intelligent routing decisions.

### **How It Works**
```
Input: Transaction context + Historical lessons + PSP candidates
‚Üì
LLM Processing: Analyzes context, considers options, applies reasoning
‚Üì
Output: Structured decision with reasoning
```

### **Why It's Powerful**
- **Context Understanding**: Considers complex relationships
- **Reasoning**: Can explain its decisions
- **Flexibility**: Handles edge cases and new scenarios
- **Learning**: Improves with more context and examples

### **In PSP Router**
```csharp
// LLM receives comprehensive context
var context = {
    Transaction: currentTx,
    Candidates: validCandidates,
    MerchantPreferences: preferences,
    SegmentStats: statistics,
    RelevantLessons: historicalLessons
};

// LLM makes intelligent decision
var decision = await llm.CompleteJsonAsync(systemPrompt, userInstruction, context);
// Result: {"candidate": "Stripe", "reasoning": "Best for high-risk SCA transactions"}
```

## üìö **A.8 Bandit Learning Deep Dive**

### A.1 Understanding Multi-Armed Bandits

#### What is a Multi-Armed Bandit?
A multi-armed bandit is a machine learning problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions (arms) to maximize cumulative reward over time. The name comes from slot machines (one-armed bandits) - imagine choosing between multiple slot machines to maximize winnings.

#### Key Concepts
- **Arms**: Available choices (in our case: Adyen, Stripe, Klarna, PayPal)
- **Reward**: Outcome of choosing an arm (authorization success, fee optimization)
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance between trying new arms vs using known good arms
- **Regret**: Difference between optimal choice and actual choice

### A.2 Bandit Algorithms Explained

#### Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
```csharp
// Simple epsilon-greedy logic
if (random < epsilon)
    return random_arm();  // Explore (10% of time)
else
    return best_known_arm();  // Exploit (90% of time)
```

**How it works:**
- **Exploration (Œµ%)**: Randomly try different PSPs to learn
- **Exploitation (1-Œµ%)**: Use the PSP with highest success rate
- **Learning**: Update success rates after each transaction

**Example:**
```
Œµ = 0.1 (10% exploration)
- 90% of time: Choose Adyen (best known)
- 10% of time: Randomly try Stripe/Klarna/PayPal
```

#### Thompson Sampling Algorithm
```csharp
// Bayesian approach
for each arm:
    sample = beta_distribution(alpha, beta)
    if sample > best_sample:
        best_arm = arm
return best_arm
```

**How it works:**
- **Bayesian**: Uses probability distributions instead of averages
- **Uncertainty**: Naturally balances exploration/exploitation based on confidence
- **Adaptive**: More exploration when uncertain, less when confident

### A.3 Contextual Bandits: The Game Changer

#### Traditional vs Contextual Bandits

**Traditional Bandit:**
```
Segment: "US_USD_Visa"
Decision: Always choose Adyen (89% success rate)
```

**Contextual Bandit:**
```
Segment: "US_USD_Visa"
Context: {amount: 500, risk: 30, sca: true}
Decision: Choose Stripe (better for high-risk SCA transactions)
```

#### Context Feature Engineering

Our implementation extracts features from transaction context:

```csharp
// Transaction context
var context = {
    "amount": 150.00m,      // ‚Üí 150.0
    "risk_score": 25,       // ‚Üí 25.0
    "sca_required": true,   // ‚Üí 1.0
    "currency": "USD",      // ‚Üí 0.123 (hash-based)
    "merchant_tier": "premium" // ‚Üí 0.456 (hash-based)
};

// Extracted features
var features = {
    "amount": 150.0,
    "risk_score": 25.0,
    "sca_required": 1.0,
    "currency": 0.123,
    "merchant_tier": 0.456
};
```

#### Contextual Scoring Algorithm

```csharp
score = base_success_rate + contextual_bonus

// Base success rate
base_success_rate = total_rewards / total_attempts

// Contextual bonus
contextual_bonus = Œ£(similarity * 0.1)
similarity = 1.0 - |context_value - arm_learned_value|
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Adyen for "US_USD_Visa":
- Base rate: 0.89
- Learned features: {amount: 200, risk: 20, sca: 0.3}
- Current context: {amount: 150, risk: 25, sca: 1.0}

Similarity calculations:
- amount: 1.0 - |150-200|/max(150,200) = 0.75
- risk: 1.0 - |25-20|/max(25,20) = 0.8
- sca: 1.0 - |1.0-0.3| = 0.3

Contextual bonus: (0.75 + 0.8 + 0.3) * 0.1 = 0.185
Final score: 0.89 + 0.185 = 1.075
```

### A.4 Learning Process Deep Dive

#### 1. Initial State (Cold Start)
```
All PSPs start with no data:
Adyen: {sum: 0, count: 0, features: {}}
Stripe: {sum: 0, count: 0, features: {}}
```

#### 2. First Transactions (Exploration)
```
Transaction 1: $100, risk=10, sca=false
‚Üí Random selection: Adyen
‚Üí Outcome: Success (reward=1.0)
‚Üí Update: Adyen {sum: 1.0, count: 1, features: {amount: 100, risk: 10, sca: 0}}

Transaction 2: $200, risk=30, sca=true  
‚Üí Random selection: Stripe
‚Üí Outcome: Success (reward=0.8) // Lower due to fees
‚Üí Update: Stripe {sum: 0.8, count: 1, features: {amount: 200, risk: 30, sca: 1}}
```

#### 3. Learning Phase (Exploitation with Exploration)
```
Transaction 3: $150, risk=20, sca=false
‚Üí Context: {amount: 150, risk: 20, sca: 0}
‚Üí Adyen score: 1.0 + similarity_bonus = 1.05
‚Üí Stripe score: 0.8 + similarity_bonus = 0.85
‚Üí Choose: Adyen (exploitation)
```

#### 4. Mature Learning (Smart Decisions)
```
After 1000+ transactions:
Adyen: {sum: 850, count: 1000, features: {amount: 180, risk: 15, sca: 0.2}}
Stripe: {sum: 780, count: 1000, features: {amount: 220, risk: 25, sca: 0.6}}

Transaction: $300, risk=40, sca=true
‚Üí Context: {amount: 300, risk: 40, sca: 1}
‚Üí Adyen: 0.85 + low_similarity_bonus = 0.87
‚Üí Stripe: 0.78 + high_similarity_bonus = 0.92
‚Üí Choose: Stripe (contextual decision!)
```

### A.5 Reward Function Design

#### Multi-Factor Reward Calculation
```csharp
reward = base_auth_reward - fee_penalty + speed_bonus - risk_penalty

// Base reward
base_auth_reward = authorized ? 1.0 : 0.0

// Fee penalty (normalized)
fee_penalty = fee_amount / transaction_amount

// Speed bonus
speed_bonus = processing_time < 1000ms ? 0.1 : 0.0

// Risk penalty
risk_penalty = risk_score > 50 ? 0.2 : 0.0

// Clamp to [-1, 1]
final_reward = max(-1.0, min(1.0, reward))
```

#### Example Reward Calculations
```
Transaction 1: $100, authorized=true, fee=$2.30, time=800ms, risk=20
reward = 1.0 - 0.023 + 0.1 - 0.0 = 1.077 ‚Üí 1.0

Transaction 2: $100, authorized=false, fee=$0, time=2000ms, risk=60  
reward = 0.0 - 0.0 + 0.0 - 0.2 = -0.2

Transaction 3: $1000, authorized=true, fee=$20.30, time=1200ms, risk=30
reward = 1.0 - 0.0203 + 0.0 - 0.0 = 0.9797
```

### A.6 Performance Characteristics

#### Convergence Analysis
```
Transactions 1-100:    High exploration, learning patterns
Transactions 100-500:  Balanced exploration/exploitation  
Transactions 500+:     Mostly exploitation, fine-tuning
```

#### Memory Usage
```
Per segment: ~1KB (statistics + features)
1000 segments: ~1MB total
Features per arm: ~100 bytes
```

#### Computational Complexity
```
Selection: O(arms √ó features) = O(4 √ó 10) = O(40) operations
Update: O(features) = O(10) operations
Total: Very fast, suitable for real-time routing
```

### A.7 Advanced Features

#### Feature Decay (Optional Enhancement)
```csharp
// Gradually forget old patterns
foreach (feature in arm_features):
    feature.value = feature.value * 0.99  // 1% decay per update
```

#### Segment Hierarchies (Optional Enhancement)
```csharp
// Learn at multiple levels
Global: All transactions
Country: US transactions  
Currency: US USD transactions
Scheme: US USD Visa transactions
```

#### Confidence Intervals (Optional Enhancement)
```csharp
// Track uncertainty
confidence = 1.0 / sqrt(count)
if confidence > threshold:
    explore_more()
```
